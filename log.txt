File operations in C are essential for interacting with the file system. They allow a program to create, read, write, and modify files. These operations are done using high-level functions from `stdio.h` like `fopen()`, `fread()`, `fwrite()`, `fgets()`, and `fclose()`.

C also supports low-level file handling through system calls like `open()`, `read()`, `write()`, and `close()` from `fcntl.h` and `unistd.h`, offering more control over file descriptors and permissions. These are commonly used in system programming.

To access and manipulate file metadata, the `stat()` and `lstat()` functions from `sys/stat.h` are used. These functions return details like file type, size, and permissions.

C can also manage directories using functions from `dirent.h`. You can open a directory using `opendir()`, read contents with `readdir()`, and close it using `closedir()`.

Files can be truncated with `truncate()`, and special files like FIFOs (named pipes) can be created using `mkfifo()`. These are useful in inter-process communication.

Permissions and file types (regular file, directory, symbolic link) can be checked using macros like `S_ISREG()`, `S_ISDIR()`, etc.

C supports reading and writing both text and binary files. Binary files are handled using `fread()` and `fwrite()`.

Error handling is crucial in file operations. Always check if file functions return `NULL` or `-1`, and use `perror()` or `strerror()` for debugging.

Efficient file handling includes proper opening and closing of files, avoiding memory leaks, and ensuring data is written using `fflush()` when needed.

File operations are foundational in system-level programming, scripting tools, and embedded software development.
