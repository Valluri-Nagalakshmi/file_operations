1. How does Bluetooth work?
2. What is the difference between structure and union in C?*

3. Code Snippet:*

c
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int x = 2, y = 5;
    (x & y) ? printf("true") : printf("false");
    (x && y) ? printf("true") : printf("false");
}


*Output:* ???
Explain the output of this code and why it behaves that way.

*4. What are the Wi-Fi protocol layers?*
List and explain the OSI or TCP/IP layers involved in Wi-Fi communication and their respective roles.

---

*5. Given a set of numbers where all elements occur an even number of times except one number. Find the odd occurring number.*


*6. Given an array of size n-1 with distinct integers in the range [1, n], this array represents a permutation of integers from 1 to n with one missing element. Find the missing element in the array.*

* *Input:* arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 5}

* *Output:* 4

* *Explanation:* The array size is 4. The missing number between 1 to 5 is 4.
